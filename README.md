The rough draft of my final project is rougher than I would like it to be. Formatting and managing the data was a little more complicated than I anticipated it to be.  I encountered many obstacles getting my map to its present version.  Unfortunately, I ran out of time trying to figure out how to update choropleth base map when the  slide bar is manipulated by the user. I will also need to alter my data or find an alternate dataset to create the proportional symbols of for each country.
